    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>Dr. Yasin - Question 1</span> In the membrane of the pre-synaptic neuron, the neurotransmitter is released in response to which of the following events?",
    "options": [
      "Opening of Na+ channels",
      "Opening of K+ channels",
      "Opening of Ca++ voltage-gated channels",
      "Closing of Clâˆ’ channels"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "answerText": "Opening of Ca++ voltage-gated channels",
    "explanation": "The influx of Ca++ through voltage-gated calcium channels triggers neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft.",

    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>Dr. Yasin - Question 2</span> The release of inhibitory neurotransmitter leads to which of the changes in the postsynaptic membrane?",
    "options": [
      "Opening of Na+ channels",
      "Opening of K+ channels at the surface of the postsynaptic membrane",
      "Closing of K+ channels",
      "Depolarization of the membrane"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "answerText": "Opening of K+ channels at the surface of the postsynaptic membrane",
    "explanation": "Inhibitory neurotransmitters cause hyperpolarization by opening K+ channels, making the postsynaptic membrane less excitable.  .. *** : mean correct answer .",
