    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>Second Batch (2024-12-1) Dr. Panahi - Question 1</span> Which of the following is NOT a cause of Respiratory alkalosis?",
    "options": [
      "Anxiety",
      "High altitude",
      "COPD",
      "Pulmonary embolism"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "answerText": "COPD",
    "explanation": "Respiratory alkalosis is typically caused by conditions that lead to hyperventilation, such as anxiety or high altitude. COPD generally leads to respiratory acidosis due to impaired gas exchange.",

      "Respiratory acidosis",
      "Metabolic acidosis"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "answerText": "Respiratory acidosis",
    "explanation": "The low pH and elevated PaCO2 indicate respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation or impaired CO2 removal.",
