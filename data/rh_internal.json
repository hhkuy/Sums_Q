    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>SLE - Question 1</span> Heart failure is defined as the inability of the heart to do which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "Deliver adequate blood flow to meet the body's needs",
      "Pump blood at high pressure",
      "Increase heart rate and contractility",
      "Decrease systemic vascular resistance"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "answerText": "Deliver adequate blood flow to meet the body's needs",
    "explanation": "Heart failure is the inability of the heart to maintain sufficient cardiac output to meet the metabolic demands of the body.  ",

  {
    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>SLE - Question 2</span> Which of the following is a typical symptom of left-sided heart failure?",
    "options": [
      "Peripheral edema",
      "Orthopnea",
      "Jugular venous distention",
      "Hepatomegaly"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "answerText": "Orthopnea",
    "explanation": "Orthopnea is a classic symptom of left-sided heart failure, caused by pulmonary congestion and difficulty breathing while lying flat.  ",

  {
    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>SLE - Question 3</span> Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors in heart failure?",
    "options": [
      "Increase sympathetic activity",
      "Increase sodium and water retention",
      "Decrease afterload and preload",
      "Increase aldosterone secretion"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "answerText": "Decrease afterload and preload",
    "explanation": "ACE inhibitors decrease afterload (via vasodilation) and preload (via decreased blood volume), improving symptoms of heart failure.  ",
    "userAnswer": null,
    "qID": "rh-inte-q3"

  {
    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>SLE - Question 4</span> In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), which of the following is typically decreased?",
    "options": [
      "End-diastolic volume",
      "Left ventricular ejection fraction",
      "Left ventricular mass",
      "Sympathetic nervous system activity"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "answerText": "Left ventricular ejection fraction",
    "explanation": "HFrEF is characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 40%).  ",

  {
    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>SLE - Question 5</span> Which of the following compensatory mechanisms in heart failure is associated with increased preload and can lead to congestion?",
    "options": [
      "Increased parasympathetic tone",
      "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)",
      "Decreased sympathetic activity",
      "Decreased antidiuretic hormone (ADH)"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "answerText": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)",
    "explanation": "Activation of the RAAS increases sodium and water retention, raising preload and potentially worsening congestion.",
