    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>Patho Question 1</span> A 35-year-old woman with active lupus nephritis falls forward and lands on her left hand. She has immediate pain. On examination there is crepitus at the wrist. A radiograph shows radial and navicular fractures along with marked osteopenia. Which of the following medications most likely contributed to the fracture?",
    "options": [
      "Hydrocortisone",
      "Ibuprofen",
      "Lisinopril",
      "Losartan",
      "Methotrexate"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "answerText": "Hydrocortisone",
    "explanation": "Chronic use of glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone is known to cause decreased bone mineral density, leading to osteopenia and increased risk of fractures.",

    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>Patho Question 2</span> A 71-year-old man has experienced aching pain in the right knee, lower back, right distal fifth finger, and neck over the past 10 years. He notices that the joints feel slightly stiff in the morning, but this passes quickly. The pain is worse toward the end of the day. On physical examination, there is no joint swelling, warmth, or deformity. Some joint crepitus is audible on moving the knee. Laboratory studies show normal levels of serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid. What is the most likely cause of hypercalcemia?",
    "options": [
      "Ankylosing spondylitis",
      "Gouty arthritis",
      "Multiple myeloma",
      "Osteoarthritis",
      "Pseudogout",
      "Rheumatoid arthritis"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "answerText": "Osteoarthritis",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario is most consistent with osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes joint pain and crepitus without systemic inflammation. Although osteoarthritis itself does not directly cause hypercalcemia, no other option in this list fits the described symptoms better. The mention of hypercalcemia may be a distractor or misphrasing, as the labs are reported normal.",

    "question": "<span style=\"color: darkred; font-weight:bold;\">Patho Question 3</span> A 30-year-old man has had cramping abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea for the past 4 days. On physical examination, there is diffuse tenderness on palpation of the abdomen. Bowel sounds are present. There are no masses and no organomegaly. A stool culture is positive for Shigella flexneri. The episode resolves spontaneously within 1 week after onset. Six weeks later, he has increasingly severe lower back pain. Physical examination now shows stiffness of the lumbar spine and tenderness of the sacroiliac joints. He is treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Two months later, the back pain recurs, and he complains of redness of the right eye and blurred vision. Serologic testing for which of the following is most likely to be positive in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "Chlamydia trachomatis",
      "Epstein-Barr virus",
      "HLA-B27",
      "Rheumatoid factor"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "answerText": "HLA-B27",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with reactive arthritis, a form of seronegative spondyloarthritis often triggered by gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections (e.g., Shigella, Chlamydia). The classic triad includes arthritis, urethritis, and uveitis. HLA-B27 is strongly associated with this condition.",

    "question": "<span style=\"color: darkred; font-weight:bold;\">Patho Question 4</span> A 34-year-old woman has experienced malaise, fatigue, and joint pain for the past 5 months. She has had progressive loss of joint motion, making it more difficult to walk and to use her hands. On physical examination, the joint involvement is symmetric, and most of the affected joints are in the hands and feet. The involved joints are swollen and warm to the touch. The second and third digits on the right hand have a swan neck deformity, and there is ulnar deviation of both hands. Reconstructive surgery is performed on her right hand. Microscopic views of the excised joint capsule tissue are shown in the figure. Which of the following serologic laboratory test findings is most likely to be positive in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "Antiâ€“DNA topoisomerase I antibody",
      "Antinuclear antibody",
      "Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "Campylobacter jejuni",
      "Citrullinated peptides"
    ],
    "answer": 4,
    "answerText": "Citrullinated peptides",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation is consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, characterized by symmetric joint involvement, deformities like swan neck and ulnar deviation, and chronic synovial inflammation. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis and often appear before clinical symptoms.",
