      "Opening of Ca++ voltage-gated channels",
      "Closing of Clâˆ’ channels"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "answerText": "Opening of Ca++ voltage-gated channels",
    "explanation": "The influx of Ca++ through voltage-gated calcium channels triggers neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft.",

    "options": [
      "Opening of Na+ channels",
      "Opening of K+ channels at the surface of the postsynaptic membrane",
      "Closing of K+ channels",
      "Depolarization of the membrane"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "answerText": "Opening of K+ channels at the surface of the postsynaptic membrane",
    "explanation": "Inhibitory neurotransmitters cause hyperpolarization by opening K+ channels, making the postsynaptic membrane less excitable.",
