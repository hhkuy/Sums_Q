    "question": "<span style='color: darkred; font-weight:bold;'>September 2016 - Question 172</span> Effective health counseling skills are a critical component of meeting the educational needs of patients and families and providing expert coaching and guidance for people who are managing diabetes on a daily basis. Health counseling includes skills such as effectively providing information, counseling patients about available options, and helping them make well-informed decisions through a client-centered approach. A positive interaction between the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) and the patient can have a positive effect on diabetes management. The CNS can help to make the interaction positive by showing sensitivity to the patient and by having empathy and understanding of the patient's feeling, which will also enhance patient satisfaction. Another approach to improving adherence is to establish a therapeutic contract with the patient in which the patient and provider work together to set goals, assign responsibilities, and set a date for attaining the goal. Research has shown that positive lifestyle change for people with diabetes is facilitated by long-term, collaborative relationships with healthcare providers. Further, long-term follow-up with regular reinforcement is most effective for sustaining change in diet and physical activity, which have been identified as the first and the second most difficult behaviors for people with diabetes to change. The passage is mainly about ..........",

Then mark your answer sheet.<br/><br/>The prevalence of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults ranges from 0.19 to 21 percent. The range is wide because of differing definition of clinically significant microscopic hematuria and varying ages of the study populations. Urine normally contains a few red blood cells, and microscopic hematuria generally is defined as one to 10 red blood cells per high-power field of urine sediment. The American Urological Association (AUA) defines clinically significant microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic evaluation of urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. Each laboratory, however, establishes its own thresholds based on the method of detection used and in reference to healthy persons as controls. Urine dipstick evaluation may be misleading because it lacks the ability to distinguish red blood cells from myoglobin or hemoglobin. Therefore, a positive finding of microscopic hematuria on urinary dipstick testing required follow-up examination by microscopic technique to confirm the presence of red blood cells. Microscopic hematuria, unlike gross hematuria, is often an incidental finding but may be associated with urologic malignancy in up to 10 percent of adults. Despite the risk, result of recent study revealed that 39 to 90 percent of persons with microscopic hematuria on screening urinalysis received no follow-up testing. Microscopic hematuria presents a challenging clinical scenario for family physicians.<br/><br/>A follow-up examination by microscopic technique may be needed to...........",
